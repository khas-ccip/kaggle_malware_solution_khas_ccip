# kaggle_malware_solution_khas_ccip

Hello!

Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my solution for the Microsoft Malware Prediction competition.
If you run into any trouble with the setup/code or have any questions please contact me at aykut.cayir@khas.edu.tr

#HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (3.8 TB boot disk)
i9-7900X CPU @ 3.30GHz Ã— 20, 32 GB memory
2 x NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti

#SOFTWARE (python packages are detailed separately in `requirements.txt`):
Python 3.6.8
CUDA 10.0
nvidia drivers v.410.104

#DATA PROCESSING
# The train/predict code will also call this script if it has not already been run on the relevant data.
python ./code/prepare_data.py

#MODEL BUILD: There are three options to produce the solution.
shell command to run each build is below

#1) prediction
python ./code/predict.py

#2) train models (overwrites models in comp_model directory)
python ./code/train.py
